## What is this?

A React design system with a component library built on top of `react-aria`, a wonderful accessibility library, and `vanilla-extract`, lightweight and powerful styling solution.

## Why was it build?

There are many extremely popular design systems with excellent React components, but vast majority of them ticks at least one of the boxes:

- Does not feature full accessibility support.
- Cannot be separated from the product it was created for.
- Does not go as deep as I would like to (using browser select dropdown instead of custom solution).
