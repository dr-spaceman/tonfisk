Tonfisk uses `vanilla-extract` for styling. This means that type-safe styles live in `*.css.ts` files. They are exported during build process and are meant to be consumed by the end user's bundler.

Check example [`webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/tchayen/tonfisk/blob/main/examples/webpack/webpack.config.js) and [`next.config.js`](https://github.com/tchayen/tonfisk/blob/main/examples/next/next.config.js) as well as [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/) setup documentation to learn more about it.

## No-setup alternative

There are plans to provide alternative bundle with all CSS packed together.

It would allow people to use `tonfisk` without setting up `vanilla-extract` (for example in CRA).

Unfortunately, it wouldn't allow for tree-shaking the CSS as it would be a final bundled `main.css` file.
