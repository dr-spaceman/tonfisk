## Spacing

Most commonly used margin is of size `"l"`, which equals `16px`. This is usually value of the padding from borders and space between separate entities.

Elements that go strictly together, such as label and text input, are separated by `"s"` (`4px`) margin.

## Focus

Each interactive element should respect keyboard focus, that is, it should react and reflect visually when it gains focus from keyboard actions.

Elements should not show their focus state when interacting with mouse. For implementation reference check source code of the [Button](/docs/components/button) component.

## Interactive elements

Every interactive element should have the following states reflected in UI:

- Default state
- Hover
- Keyboard focus
- Active

Try putting your mouse cursor over the button, press and hold it, use tab to move focus around and see how it reacts.

<Button>Press me</Button>

## When to use popover and when modal dialog

Role of popover is to support a part of the application while being part of it. Dropdown box in select is an example of popover.

Modal dialog is responsible for grabbing user's attention. It dims background and doesn't allow any interaction with outside elements until dismissing it.

<FlexRow>
  <PopoverExample />
  <ModalExample />
</FlexRow>
