## Installation

```bash
yarn add TODO_LIB_NAME
```

## Setup

`<Provider />` is absolutely required for the library to run. There should be only one provider in the component tree.

```jsx
import { Provider } from "TODO_LIB_NAME";

export default function App() {
  return <Provider>{/* Your app */}</Provider>;
}
```

Set up `vanilla-extract` according to your bundler settings: [guide](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/).

## Usage

Simple snippet showing how to get started:

```jsx
import { Button } from "TODO_LIB_NAME";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onPress={() => console.log("Hej!")}>Press me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Flow of writing

Most of the code can be composed using ready components. But often there will be situations custom enough that it won't make sense to have ready-made components in the design system. That's why TODO_LIB_NAME leverages `vanilla-extract` and fully type safe styling.

Example code can look like this:

```jsx
<div
  className={atoms({
    display: "flex",
    gap: "m",
    padding: "m",
    boxShadow: {
      lightMode: "regularBorder",
      darkMode: "darkBorder",
    },
    borderRadius: "8px",
  })}
>
  <p>Hello there.</p>
  <Button
    onPress={() => {
      console.log("Hej!");
    }}
  >
    Press me
  </Button>
</div>
```
