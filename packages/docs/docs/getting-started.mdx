## Installation

```bash
yarn add @tchayen/design-system
```

## Usage

`<Provider />` is required for internal theme to be applied to components.

```jsx
import { Provider } from "@tchayen/design-system";

export default function App() {
  return <Provider>{/* Your app */}</Provider>;
}
```

### Dark mode

`<MagicScriptTag />` can be used in `_document.tsx` in `Next.js` and its purpose is to prevent page flickering on refresh.

```jsx
import { MagicScriptTag } from "@tchayen/design-system";

// ...
<MagicScriptTag />;
```

## Underneath

This project uses [`emotion`](https://emotion.sh) üë©‚Äçüé§ styling library.

[`react-aria`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria) is used for providing top notch accessibility.

TODO: fix those links above (just using Link from next is not enough, `<a />` must be also used inside).
