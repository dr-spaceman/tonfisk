## Installation

```bash
yarn add TODO_LIB_NAME
```

## Setup

`<Provider />` is absolutely required for the library to run. There should be only one provider in the component tree.

```jsx
import { Provider } from "TODO_LIB_NAME";

export default function App() {
  return <Provider>{/* Your app */}</Provider>;
}
```

Set up `vanilla-extract` according to your bundler settings: [guide](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/).

## Usage

For available components check _Components_ section of the sidebar.

If you are using Formik, you might be interested in [Formik example](/formik-example).

If you are looking for inspiration, make sure to check [Example](/example) which features advanced usage of popovers and modals.

Simple snippet showing how to get started:

```jsx
import { Button } from "TODO_LIB_NAME";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onPress={() => console.log("Hej!")}>Press me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
