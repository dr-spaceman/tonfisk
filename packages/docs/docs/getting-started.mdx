## Installation

```bash
yarn add @tchayen/design-system
```

## Setup

### Next.js

Create (if it does not exist) a `.babelrc` file and include the plugin:

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": ["@vanilla-extract/babel-plugin"]
}
```

Include the Next.js plugin in your config in the `next.config.js`.

```js
const { createVanillaExtractPlugin } = require("@vanilla-extract/next-plugin");
const withVanillaExtract = createVanillaExtractPlugin();

const nextConfig = {};

module.exports = withVanillaExtract(nextConfig);
```

`<Provider />` is required for internal theme to be applied to components.

```jsx
import { Provider } from "@tchayen/design-system";

export default function App() {
  return <Provider>{/* Your app */}</Provider>;
}
```

## Underneath

This project uses [`vanilla-extract`](https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract) for styling.

[`react-aria`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria) is used for providing top notch accessibility.

TODO: fix those links above (just using Link from next is not enough, `<a />` must be also used inside).
