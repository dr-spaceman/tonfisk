## Installation

```bash
yarn add tonfisk
```

## Setup

In order to get up and running with the package, please follow the steps below.

### Provider

`<TonfiskProvider />` is absolutely required for the library to run. There should be only one provider in the component tree.

```jsx
import { TonfiskProvider } from "tonfisk";

export default function App() {
  return <TonfiskProvider>{/* Your app */}</TonfiskProvider>;
}
```

### Styling

Set up `vanilla-extract` according to your bundler settings: [guide](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/).

### Dark theme

In order to avoid a flash of white background when the user is supposed to see dark mode, copy content of [noflash.js](/noflash.js) file and save it as `noflash.js` file to `/public` directory of your repository.

If you are using Next.js, it will be `/public`.

Next, if you have your own custom `index.html`, add `<script src="/noflash.js"></script>` inside `<body>`.

If you are using Next.js, you will need `_document.js`:

```js
import Document, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
    return { ...initialProps };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <script src="/noflash.js" />
          {/* ^ here */}
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

## Usage

Simple snippet showing how to get started:

```jsx
import { TonfiskProvider, Button } from "tonfisk";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TonfiskProvider>
        <Button onPress={() => console.log("Hej!")}>Press me</Button>
      </TonfiskProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Flow of writing

Most of the code can be composed using ready components. But often there will be situations custom enough that it won't make sense to have ready-made components in the design system. That's why tonfisk leverages `vanilla-extract` and fully type-safe styling.

Example code can look like this:

```jsx
<div
  className={atoms({
    display: "flex",
    gap: "m",
    padding: "m",
    boxShadow: {
      lightMode: "regularBorder",
      darkMode: "darkBorder",
    },
    borderRadius: "8px",
  })}
>
  <p>Hello there.</p>
  <Button
    onPress={() => {
      console.log("Hej!");
    }}
  >
    Press me
  </Button>
</div>
```

## Diving deeper

There are a few directions you can take to learn more about Tonfisk and its features.

### Explore docs

For available components check _Components_ section of the sidebar.

If you are using Formik, you might be interested in [Formik example](/formik-example).

### Check examples

If you are looking for inspiration, make sure to check [Example](/example) which features advanced usage of popovers and modals.

### Have a look at guides

They are not necessarily for everyone, but the idea is to dive deeper into some topics.
