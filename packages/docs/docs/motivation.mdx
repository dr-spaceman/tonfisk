## What is a design system

I will start by quoting a definition provided by [UXDesign](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969):

> _The single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product._

This definition is quite broad, but unforgetful. It cannot be satisfied by a library with no matter how many, but just, React components. Component library might be a core, material surface of experiencing a design system, but it cannot be successful without underlying work on the colors, typography and overall philosophy.

## Problems with existing solutions

There are many extremely popular design systems with excellent React components, but vast majority of them ticks at least one of the boxes:

### Incomplete accessibility support

As of 2021, proper a11y support in applications is a widely accepted bare minimum of a successful project and design system is a right place to take care of it.

### Branded systems

There are many beautiful, well-thought and otherwise perfect design systems that suffer from one problem â€“ they were created by a product, for a product. Using it makes any app look like it belongs to, or is affiliated to said brand. tonfisk fortunately is not a huge brand and has little chances of becoming one. Therefore it is safe to use in that regard.

### Not custom enough

Most modern design system don't feature, for example, a custom select dropdown. They simply display the OS one. Generally it is a nice practice to not embark on a massive task of implementing custom dropdown and providing proper cross-platform support for it. But, we have libraries, such as `react-aria`, that can help with that.

### Not really a design system

Small, modular and customizable design systems are not design systems but component libraries (as discussed in [What is a design system](#what-is-a-design-system)).

### Lack of public design files

Due to often dynamic nature of design system development and not always perfect communication between developers and designers, it is very hard for teams to publish their design files (Sketch, Figma) in state that they will be up-to-date and useful.

## Solutions

### Standing on the shoulders of giants

Modern development ecosystem is so big and complex that I wouldn't possibly hope to solve all problems of creating cross-platform, responsive and accessible websites.

Fortunately, solutions for accessibility problems exist, such as [`react-aria`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria) and [`reach-ui`](https://reach.tech/) (using the former here).

Styling also proved to be a complex problem and ecosystem of CSS-in-JS has been growing non-stop for the past couple of years. I settled for using [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style/), very fresh package aiming to provide zero-runtime, fully typed, stylesheets.

### No brand associacion

I don't mean this paragraph seriously, but Tonfisk is not a well-recognized product or brand as of late 2021 and risk of it becoming one is negligible.

### No compromises

If there is a part of UI styling that can be reliably overriden, I will do so. As long as underlying libraries provide a convenient tooling (see: [Standing on the shoulders of giants](standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants)), I want to replace any platform specific select dropdown, tooltip etc. with unified elements.

### Design system with all of the consequences

At the moment I don't think React ecosystem needs another generic component library. What is missing, on the other hand, is in my opinion fully featured design systems that are directed towards guiding users, providing examples and teaching.

### Figma files

Even though Tonfisk aims to be a set of composable elements that speed up creating of websites, speed and comfort of writing React code won't beat fully featured design tools. Therefore one of the key goals is to provide up-to-date design file from Figma.

## Why the name?

My friend suggested to use some Swedish word for that (as I currently live in Sweden). We started with snail, but _snigel_ didn't feel quite right so I settled on tuna.
