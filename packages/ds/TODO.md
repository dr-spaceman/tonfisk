Potential reference for customizing MDX Bundler setup:

- https://github.com/Arcath/arcath.net-next/blob/8c6def31929a65c7c5eb61ea56cc1d02833f6479/lib/functions/prepare-mdx.ts#L66

## Must have

- [ ] If user's OS prefers dark mode then it will start that way properly but color switch button will show sun first.
- [ ] Make homepage responsive.
- [ ] Make doc pages and navigation responsive.
- [ ] Order guides without need for `\d+\-[A-z]+` pattern in the name.

## Decisions

- [ ] Animate fade in/out of modals:
      https://formium.io/ - animate transform and opacity
      https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/
      https://gist.github.com/igoldny/c40d36c8863d525a581391b76371c086
- [ ] Consider changing default sizes of elements from 32 to 40px.
- [ ] Change the general idea about outlines. Especially on gray buttons they should go inside component as 2px `blue-500` instead of 3px opacity outside.

## Nice to have

- [ ] Add link to GitHub source of example in example.
- [ ] Add select and checkbox to Formik guide.
- [ ] Ability to remove choice from select.
- [ ] API Cheat Sheet inspired by baseweb https://baseweb.design/cheat-sheet/.
- [ ] Button variant (link).
- [ ] Create wrapper next+babel plugins with `vanilla-extract`.
- [ ] `(?)` button? for form labels that show tooltip.
- [ ] Interactive props in examples https://baseweb.design/components/pin-code/.
- [ ] Review styles to find out what is worth reusing.
- [ ] Releases tab as in Braid https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Box/releases
- [ ] Search in docs.
- [ ] Any element as menu button `children` (example of ðŸ¦Š wallet in Figma).
- [ ] Current header solution doesn't support nested tags there (i.e. `## What is a _design system_` will break as it is returned as array of `[string, ReactNode]`).
- [ ] Refactor example a lot, share code, get rid of props spaghetti, split main form into two components.

## Bugs

- [ ] Pagination dots popover does not always appear on keyboard.
- [ ] Case of custom input like in example: how to provide label to the input.
- [ ] When button is focused but becomes disabled (pagination) it remains with outline and has it until activated and visited again.

## New components

- [ ] Accordion
- [ ] Radio
- [ ] [RadioGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useRadioGroup.html)
- [ ] [CheckboxGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useCheckboxGroup.html)
- [ ] [SearchField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSearchField.html)
- [ ] [Breadcrumbs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useBreadcrumbs.html)
- [ ] [ProgressBar](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useProgressBar.html)
- [ ] [ComboBox](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useComboBox.html)
- [ ] [Slider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSlider.html)
- [ ] TabList
- [ ] Date picker, Time picker, Timezone picker
- [ ] Side navigation [Baseweb/side-nav](https://baseweb.design/components/side-nav)
