## Must have

- [ ] Case of custom input like in example: how to provide label to the input.

- [ ] Update spinner to feature background for the circle in the outline color.
- [ ] When button is focused but becomes disabled (pagination) it remains with outline and has it until activated and visited again.
- [ ] User text selection color and background.
- [ ] [50%] Some generic landing page?

## Next version

- [ ] Order of modals in example is wrong (settings and warning).
- [ ] Create wrapper next+babel plugins with `vanilla-extract`.
- [ ] Button variants (link).

- [ ] `<Radio />`.
- [ ] `<RadioGroup />`.
- [ ] `<CheckboxGroup />`.
- [ ] `<SearchField />`.
- [ ] `<Breadcrumbs />`.
- [ ] `<ProgressBar />`.
- [ ] `<ComboBox />`.
- [ ] `<Slider />`.
- [ ] `<TabList />`.

## Nice to have

- [ ] Borderless text input.
- [ ] Ability to remove choice from select.
- [ ] Pagination: popover that appears on click on [...] that allows to select arbitrary page.
- [ ] Any element as menu button `children` (example of ðŸ¦Š wallet in Figma).
- [ ] Style `<code>` tags in MDX and override `pre code` through globals to avoid padding and background there.
- [x] Placeholder color.
- [ ] Find out how to access theme in regular JS (not in `atoms`).
- [ ] Missing TS typings (especially `Table`, `Menu`).
- [ ] Expose API for switching color modes.
- [ ] Style browser scrollbars https://github.com/tchayen/md-editor/commit/af7cb357bd6cd6064004af4200ce46ff4a45e7c7.
- [ ] Interactive props in examples.
- [ ] Bigger examples to find out missing components.
- [ ] Fully configurable tooltips: system for deciding where tooltip should appear in relation to wrapped content (`bottom-center`, `bottom-left` etc.) and same mechanism for deciding on the arrow placement.
