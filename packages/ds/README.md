## Must have

- [ ] [50%] Some generic landing page?
- [ ] Pagination dots popover does not always appear on keyboard.

## Next version

- [ ] Change design and implement new look for switch to look like classic iOS switch and not material design one.
- [ ] When button is focused but becomes disabled (pagination) it remains with outline and has it until activated and visited again.
- [ ] Update spinner to feature background for the circle in the outline color.
- [ ] Case of custom input like in example: how to provide label to the input.
- [ ] Change focus outline on buttons to look more like twitter.
- [ ] Create wrapper next+babel plugins with `vanilla-extract`.
- [ ] Button variants (link).

- [ ] Accordion
- [ ] Radio
- [ ] RadioGroup
- [ ] CheckboxGroup
- [ ] SearchField
- [ ] Breadcrumbs
- [ ] [ProgressBar](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useProgressBar.html)
- [ ] [ComboBox](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useComboBox.html)
- [ ] [Slider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSlider.html)
- [ ] TabList

## Nice to have

- [ ] Releases tab as in Braid https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Box/releases
- [ ] Borderless text input.
- [ ] Ability to remove choice from select.
- [ ] Any element as menu button `children` (example of ðŸ¦Š wallet in Figma).
- [ ] Style `<code>` tags in MDX and override `pre code` through globals to avoid padding and background there.
- [ ] Find out how to access theme in regular JS (not in `atoms`).
- [ ] Missing TS typings (especially `Table`, `Menu`).
- [ ] Expose API for switching color modes.
- [ ] Interactive props in examples.
- [ ] Fully configurable tooltips: system for deciding where tooltip should appear in relation to wrapped content (`bottom-center`, `bottom-left` etc.) and same mechanism for deciding on the arrow placement.
