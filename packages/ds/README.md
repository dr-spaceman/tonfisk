## Must have

- [ ] Rename table components without prefix Table to contain it.
- [ ] [50%] Some generic landing page?
- [ ] Review styles to find out what is worth reusing.
- [ ] Animate fade in/out of modals (https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/).

### Example improvements

- [ ] Make tick and selection in tables white in dark mode and text white in light mode.
- [ ] Refactor example a lot, share code, get rid of props spaghetti, split main form into two components.
- [ ] In example, when user presses swap, show non-dismisable modal with progress of transaction (TODO: find out what are the steps).

## Bugs

- [ ] Pagination dots popover does not always appear on keyboard.
- [ ] Case of custom input like in example: how to provide label to the input.
- [ ] When button is focused but becomes disabled (pagination) it remains with outline and has it until activated and visited again.

## Next version

- [ ] `(?)` button? for form labels that show tooltip.
- [ ] Create wrapper next+babel plugins with `vanilla-extract`.
- [ ] Button variants (link).
- [ ] Ability to remove choice from select.

- [ ] Accordion
- [ ] Radio
- [ ] [RadioGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useRadioGroup.html)
- [ ] [CheckboxGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useCheckboxGroup.html)
- [ ] [SearchField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSearchField.html)
- [ ] [Breadcrumbs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useBreadcrumbs.html)
- [ ] [ProgressBar](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useProgressBar.html)
- [ ] [ComboBox](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useComboBox.html)
- [ ] [Slider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSlider.html)
- [ ] TabList

## Nice to have

- [ ] Order guides without need for `\d+\-[A-z]+` pattern in the name.
- [ ] Releases tab as in Braid https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Box/releases
- [ ] Borderless text input.
- [ ] Any element as menu button `children` (example of ðŸ¦Š wallet in Figma).
- [ ] Missing TS typings (especially `Table`, `Menu`).
- [ ] Expose API for switching color modes.
- [ ] Interactive props in examples.
- [ ] Fully configurable tooltips: system for deciding where tooltip should appear in relation to wrapped content (`bottom-center`, `bottom-left` etc.) and same mechanism for deciding on the arrow placement.
